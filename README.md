# LSTM-ARIMA, A HYBRID APPROACH TO ALGORITHMIC INVESTMENT STRATEGY

### Hello!
#
### I created this strategy for my bachelor thesis. I am very happy to announce that my strategy of combining the LSTM and ARIMA model together outperformed all the model individaully. You can see the results in a PDF file generated via R-Markdown in hte folder "Results in R-Markdown". The code for the strategy is written using Python3 and I have used the tensorflow library for ML tasks. 

#### I have used Random Search for Hyperparameter Tunning and the best set of hyperparameter is chosen based on the conditions presented in the Resutls PDF file. Furthermore, I would like to give credits to Dr. Robert Slepaczuk for giving me the right direction of moving towards th ecreation of the model and the backtesting including the Performance Metrics.

#### Should you have any questions, please contact me on GitHub.
