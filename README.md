# Bachelor-Thesis

### Hello!
#
### This is my repository for my bachelor thesis. 
#
#### Note that all the algorithms are divided seperately in each folder: ARIMA, LSTM, ARIMA-LSTM.
#### Each instrument has its own notebook with sensitivity analysis being in a seperate notebook. 
#### All the notebooks have a seperate .py file for functions. In the notebook we are just reading the functions and placing arguements.
#### The code for performance metrics is in a seperate forlder. Please note that my performance metrics were done with the help of Karol Chojancki.
#### The final thesis is in the R - Markdown folder named Thesis.pdf.
